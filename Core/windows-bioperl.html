<big> Disclaimer&nbsp; </big><br>
     I could play the part of a bio-informatician and of a perl programmer
 on  TV. However,I'm not intimately familiar with either WinNT or Bioperl.
 Also,  I haven't actually used bioperl on this machine (or much at all)
at  the time  of this writing. &nbsp; Caveat emptor.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<big> Tools</big>&nbsp; <br>
     Most perl modules are distributed tarred and gzipped, so you will need 
 a  program that can handle compressed files. WinZip (<a href="www.winzip.com">
     www.winzip.com</a>) works nicely for me. You will also need a make utility. 
  Nmake seems to be the tool of choice, and is freely available (<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN- US/Nmake15.exe">
     http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-  US/Nmake15.exe</a>
     ). Executing this self-extracting program generates the files  <b>readme.txt</b>
     , <b>nmake.err</b> and <b>nmake.exe</b>. You can copy <b>nmake.exe </b>
   and  <b>nmake.err</b> to a directory on your path, such as <tt>C:\WINNT\system32\</tt>
     , or you can copy these two files into the directories from which you
 wil  install bioperl and its dependencies. To verify which directories constitute 
  your path, you can open a command prompt (a "DOS-box") from the start menu, 
  and use the command 'path'. Don't close that window yet, we will need it.&nbsp;

</big><big>Installing ActivePerl&nbsp;</big><br>
     A more or less up-to-date version of Perl for Windows is going to be 
necessary.    The current release is perl 5.6 (build 623). Perl 5.005 should 
be fine;  5.004 will lack part of the functionality. If somehow your NT has 
Perl 5.003  or earlier installed, all bets are off. A Perl installation is 
freely available   from ActiveState (<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html">
     http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html</a>. I
used   <a href="http://www.activestate.com/download/ActivePerl/Windows/5.6/ActivePerl-5.6.0.623- MSWin32-x86-multi-thread.msi,">
     http://www.activestate.com/download/ActivePerl/Windows/5.6/ActivePerl-5.6.0.623- 
   MSWin32-x86-multi-thread.msi,</a> but this link is likely to change in 
the  near  future). You will need Windows Installer 1.1 to use this binary 
file.  (<a href="http://www.activestate.com/download/contrib/Microsoft/NT/InstMsi.exe">
     http://www.activestate.com/download/contrib/Microsoft/NT/InstMsi.exe</a>
    )  If this tool is installed, doubleclicking on the .msi file you downloaded
   will start the installation process. I chose a full installation (including
   examples, docs and scripting), and elected to have my path modified and
 a  .pl file association created. For some reason, the setup program never
 asked  for a path, but installed to <tt>E:\Perl</tt>; your mileage may vary.
 Note that the only entry in you Start Menu is a shortcut to the (lovely)
documentation.&nbsp;  <br>

</big><big>Dependencies for Bioperl&nbsp; </big><br>
     A full list is provided in <a href="http://bioperl.org/Core/external.shtml">
    http://bioperl.org/Core/external.shtml</a>, as well as in <a href="http://bioperl.org/Core/POD/bptutorial.html">
    http://bioperl.org/Core/POD/bptutorial.html</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<b><small><br>
</small>External packages&nbsp;</b><br>
    I&nbsp; haven't tried to install the external packages (AceDB, Blast, 
Clustalw,   Tcoffee), or the XS based modules from <b>bioperl-ext</b>.&nbsp; 
<br>
<b><br>
    Perl modules</b>&nbsp; <br>
    The remaining dependencies are perl modules. The dependencies page mentioned 
  <b>Bundle::Bioperl</b>, but I found it quick and easy to install the modules 
 one  by one. Some of these (<b>LWP</b> and its dependencies, and <b>XML::Parser</b>
   ) are included  in the ActivePerl installation. This also implies you
shouldn't  worry about  'x<b>pat</b>'. Most of the remaining prerequisites
can be installed  using PPM, the  Perl Package Manager. (When you installed
ActivePerl, you  also installed the full documentation for perl and the ActiveState
additions.  The paragraphs  on PPM are worthwhile. Basically, PPM is CPAN.pm
for Windows.)  <br>
<br>
   The following  supposes your NT is connected to the Net.&nbsp; Start PPM 
 by typing '<tt>ppm</tt>'  at the command prompt (but doubleclicking <tt>
 Perl\bin\ppm.pl</tt>   works as well).  This gets you the '<tt>PPM&gt;</tt>
  ' prompt. You can now issue the following&nbsp; commands: <br>
<br>
<tt>install File-Temp <br>
   install IO-String <br>
   install IO-stringy<br>
    install XML-Writer&nbsp;</tt><br>
<br>
    You will be asked to confirm each install command.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
  Two final modules don't have an ActiveState port at the time of this writing.&nbsp;
 However, as both are pure perl modules, it is easy to install the CPAN versions.
 &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b>libxml</b><br>
   Download <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/libxml-perl-0.07.tar.gz">
  http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/libxml-perl-0.07.tar.gz</a>.&nbsp;
 (You might verify whether there is a more recent version using <a href="http://search.cpan.org">
  http://search.cpan.org</a>).&nbsp; Extract this archive to a temporary
directory.  At a command prompt, change&nbsp; directories to the location
where you expanded  the archive, and issue the&nbsp; following commands:
<br>
<br>
<tt>perl Makefile.pl<br>
   nmake <br>
  nmake test </tt><br>
<br>
  (This will generate a warning 'uninitialised variable', but&nbsp; will
result&nbsp;  in 'All tests successful'.) &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b> XML::Node</b>&nbsp;<br>
   Download <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/CHANG-LIU/XML-Node-  0.10.tar.gz">
  http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/CHANG-LIU/XML-Node-&nbsp; 0.10.tar.gz</a>
  .&nbsp; (You might verify whether there is a more recent version&nbsp;
using  <a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>).&nbsp;
Extract  this archive to a temporary directory. (The distribution contains&nbsp;
a  file <b>XML::Node.sgml</b>, which you will not be able to extract. You
can  safely&nbsp; ignore that, as long as the other files are extracted.&nbsp;
 At a command prompt,&nbsp; change directories to the location where you
expanded  the archive, and issue&nbsp; the following commands: <br>
<br>
<tt>perl Makefile.pl</tt> &nbsp; (will complain about the missing .sgml file;
 ignore) <br>
<tt>nmake nmake test </tt>&nbsp; (should&nbsp; give some output, interspersed 
 with 'ok1', 'ok2' and 'ok3')&nbsp; <br>
<tt>nmake install&nbsp; </tt><br>
<br>
<big> Bioperl-0.7&nbsp; </big><br>
  You can find the latest release at <a href="http://bioperl.org/Core/Latest/index.shtml">
  http://bioperl.org/Core/Latest/index.shtml</a>.&nbsp;  Download either
the  tar.gz file or the .zip file, and expand to a temporary&nbsp;  directory.
 At a command prompt, change directories to the location where&nbsp;  you
expanded the archive, and issue the following commands: <br>
<tt><br>
</tt><tt>perl Makefile.pl</tt> &nbsp; <br>
<blockquote> This warns that Bio::DB::Ace is going to be useless without additional
external &nbsp; modules. It also generates the mysterious message <tt>'Generated
sub tests. go&nbsp; make show_tests to see available subtests</tt>' to stderr.
Nmake show_tests does&nbsp; little for me, though.&nbsp; <br>
  </blockquote>
  <tt>Nmake</tt><br>
  <blockquote>This will simply set up the directory &nbsp; structure for testing
and installing. </blockquote>
    <tt><br>
  Nmake test </tt><br>
    <blockquote>This will generate &nbsp; lots of output, mostly just of the
form '<tt>t\AAChange..........ok</tt>'.<br>
 Highlights &nbsp; include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>skipped tests for Blast</li>
        <li>problems in <b>File::Temp </b>when testing Bpsilite</li>
        <li>skipped tests for Clustalw, with an URL</li>
        <li>(possibly) skipped tests for DB, if the test script finds your 
connection to the Net is down or too slow. </li>
        <li>unidentified values and failed tests for GDB</li>
        <li>an exception and failed tests&nbsp; for Index</li>
        <li>skipped tests for SearchDist, StandAloneBlast and Tcoffee. &nbsp; 
(skipped tests are due to external programs not being installed.) </li>
      </ul>
  And&nbsp; the final summary on my machine is: <br>
      <tt><br>
 Failed 2/60 test scripts, 96.67% okay.&nbsp; 16/953 subtests failed, 98.32% 
okay. 24 subtests skipped.&nbsp; </tt><br>
      <br>
 Unfortunately,&nbsp; nmake does not exit graciously at all: <br>
      <tt><br>
 NMAKE : fatal error U1077: 'C:\WINNT\system32\cmd.exe' &nbsp; : return code 
'0xff' </tt></blockquote>
      <tt><br>
 Nmake install</tt><br>
      <blockquote><br>
  This will copy the modules to your <tt>perl\site\lib\ </tt>hierarchy, so 
they are available for inclusion in your scripts. </blockquote>
