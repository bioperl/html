Perl general comments:

	o Perl 5.00404 and lower often have problems with GDB.t

	o Perl on Digital Unix, WindowsNT, and MacOS has been reported
          to have problems with the Bio::DB::GDB on module (and
          consequently the test GDB.t). This is due to different
          versions of HTML::Parser.

	o DB.t has intermittent time-out failures (which will most
	  likely cause tests 3 and/or 27 to fail)

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	  installation
