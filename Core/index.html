<h2>Core Bioperl</h2>

To use the CVS system you must have
<ul>
<li> An account on bio.perl.org
<li> secure shell (ssh)
<li> cvs 
<li> setenv'd CVS_RSH to ssh
</ul>

To start a repository from scratch, move to a clean area where you expect
to see your working Bio/ directories from, then go
<pre>
prompt%cvs -d :ext:birney@bioperl.sonsorol.org:/home/repository/bioperl checkout Bio
</pre>

This will build the Bio/ tree for you from the CVS system with all the current .pm files
in it.
<p>
Once built the command you need to know are
<ul>
<li>cvs update - updates your local copy wrt to the repository (do this first thing when you get in)
<li>cvs commit - publish your local changes to the repository (do this last thing before you leave!)
<li>cvs status - see whether files have been changed locally or in the repository
</ul>
Do these commands from the Bio directory (inside it). cvs knows where to find the repository due
to the CVS directories scattered around the place.
<p>

The structure of all cvs commands are 
<pre>
cvs ACTION
</pre>
