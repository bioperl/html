<p>
The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational 
methods routinely used in bioinformatics and life science research into a 
set of standard CPAN-style, well-documented, and freely available Perl modules. Perl 
provides unparalleled support for many tasks common in
bioinformatics and life science research yet there are no standard 
Perl modules for biology. We hope to help fill this void.
<p>
We also hope to convince people to release more of their own code into the 
public domain for others to see, learn from, use & improve. Perl is useful 
for so many different problems -- It does not make sense for 
individuals and institutions to constantly be reinventing the wheel. This 
is especially criticial for researchers and labs who lack the resources to 
hire dedicated teams of software engineers.
<p>
Bioperl modules and source code will always be freely available under 
the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/language/misc/Artistic.html">same 
terms</a> as Perl itself. 
<p>
The Bioperl project is open to all and we invite suggestions and
participation from the larger bioinformatics community. There is little formal leadership structure within the group although there is an international "core" group of members who share the responsibility of getting the official releases out the door. The
core group is very open (most of us joined after the start of the
project), and people who contribute naturally become part of the core
group.  You can follow developer discussions on the
<a href="http://bioperl.org/pipermail/bioperl-guts-l/">bioperl-guts-l list</a> 
which is where decisions about bioperl get thrashed out. Decisions are made by informal consensus. 
<p>
The core group are (as of May 2001)
<ul>
<li>Ewan Birney - <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Project Ensembl</a> & <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a>
<li>Jason Stajich - <a href="http://www.chg.duke.edu/">Duke University Center for Human Genetics</a>
<li>Hilmar Lapp - <a href="http://www.gnf.org">GNF/Novartis</a>
<li>Heikki Lehvaslaiho - <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a>
<li>Chris Dagdigian - <a href="http://www.computefarm.com">Blackstone Technology Group</a>
</ul>
Previous people involved heavily in bioperl are Steve Chervitz, Steve
Brenner, Aaron Mackey and Georg Fuellen.Many other people, most of them on this list have contributed invaluable code, comments, design advice and support. 
<p>
<b>What we stand for</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Working code versus hot air</b>
<p>
Bioperl developers tend not to waste much time arguing endlessly over the finer points of "life science standards" and design minutae and instead concentrate on writing software tools that are free and functional. We are happy to leave the posturing and sideline criticism  to others -- in the bioperl world the general rule amongst ourselves is "whomever writes the best code wins the argument."  
<p>
<b>We are not scary computer scientists -</b>
<p>
The main people at bioperl are not computer scientists but self taught
biologists who learned perl and programming generally because they had
problems that they wanted to solve. Some members have gotten deeper into the
CS side of things, but our participants are here because they use Perl to solve 
biological problems.
<p>
<b>We don't mind 'imperfect' code -</b>
<p>
Some people are very embarrassed about showing their code to others for
fear of being told that there is a better way of doing it. It is fine
to have kludges and make hacks - at least if they work - and bioperl has
a number of wince-making or obtuse bits of code. Eventually someone takes
them out and (hopefully) fixes it. Nearly all of us have made some real
howlers in our time so we've all been there. Peer/community review is a great
way to find bugs, optimize techniques and learn new things.
<p>
<b>We aren't a little tight group</b>
<p>
We honestly don't mind who does what - the people who have done the
backbone of the work have changed over time and will continue to change.
Anyone can quite easily become one of the key members
of bioperl simply by contributing.
<p>
<b>We don't have some pseudo-legal heirarchy</b>
<p>
We are a very open & informal group. The only person who is
different from anyone else is Hilmar Lapp who currently takes care of
coordination and announcement of the official Bioperl releases. 
Otherwise we just let people  actually do whatever they like 
(it is better to discuss things first of course), and make 
decisions by informal consensus.
<p>
<b>Bioperl is easy to join...</b>
<p>
Joining bioperl can be as simple as subscribing to one of our <a href="/MailList.shtml"> mailing lists</a>. Other ways people can contribute:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Help keep our signal-to-noise ratio high by contributing to the 
discussions on the email lists. There have already been a number of 
great threads ranging from bioXML to discussion of ways to code 
protein structure and alignment objects.
<li>Use the bioperl code and post bug reports or suggestions for the modules through the
<a href="/Bugs">bug interface</a>. The faster bugs are found or suggestions made, the quicker we can implement
them.
<li> Get an account on bio.perl.org by emailing <a href="mailto:dag@sonsorol.org">dag@sonsorol.org</a>. Learn how to use the cvs repository to work on the website, module documentation, scripts or code.
</ul>
<p>
There are lots of things to do in bioinformatics, and re-coding some
arcane format parsing or data structure layout should not be one of the
main things we do. Ask yourself what you spend most of your time doing...
<p>
Bioperl is all about being able to do interesting things and sharing the
ability to get through the tedium of bioinformatics.
