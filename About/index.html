<p>
The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational 
methods routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of
standard CPAN-style, well-documented, and freely available Perl modules. Perl 
provides unparalleled support for many tasks common in
bioinformatics yet there are no standard Perl modules for biology.
We hope to help fill this void.
<p>
We also hope to convince people to release more of their own code into the public domain
for others to see, learn from, use & improve. Perl is useful for so many different problems
-- It does not make sense for individuals and institutions to constantly be reinventing the
wheel. This is especially criticial for researchers and labs who lack the resources to hire
dedicated teams of programmers.
<p>
Bioperl modules and source code will always be freely available under the same terms as
Perl itself. 
<p>
The Bioperl project is open to all and we invite suggestions and
participation from the larger bioinformatics community. 
<p>
<em>The following information comes (loosely) from <a href="/cgi-bin/fom">our online FAQ-O-MATIC</a> (written in perl of course :)</em>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>We are not scary computer scientists -</b>
<p>
The main people at bioperl are not computer scientists but self taught
biologists who learned perl and programming generally because they had
problems that they wanted to solve. Some members have gotten deeper into the
CS side of things, but our participants are here because they use Perl to solve 
biological problems.
<p>
<b>We don't mind 'bad' code -</b>
<p>
Some people are very embarrassed about showing their code to others for
fear of being told that there is a better way of doing it. It is fine
to have kludges and make hacks - at least if they work - and bioperl has
a number of wince-making or obtuse bits of code. Eventually someone takes
them out and (hopefully) fixes it. Nearly all of us have made some real
howlers in our time so we've all been there. Peer/community review is a great
way to find bugs, optimize techniques and learn new things.
<p>
<b>We aren't a little tight group</b>
<p>
We honestly don't mind who does what - the people who have done the
backbone of the work have changed over time and will continue to change.
Anyone can quite easily become one of the key members
of bioperl simply by contributing.
<p>
<b>We don't have some pseudo-legal heirarchy</b>
<p>
We are a very open source, anarchistic group. The only person who is
different from anyone else is Steve Chervitz who does the official
announcing of the Bioperl releases. Otherwise we just let people actually do whatever
they like (it is better to discuss things first of course), and make
decisions by informal consensus.
<p>
<b>Bioperl is easy to join...</b>
<p>
Joining bioperl can be as simple as subscribing to one of our <a href="/MailList.html"> mailing lists</a>. Other ways people can contribute:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Help keep our signal-to-noise ratio high by contributing to the discussions on the
email lists. There have already been a number of great threads ranging from bioXML to
discussion of ways to code protein structure and alignment objects.
<li>Use the bioperl code and post bug reports or suggestions for the modules through the
<a href="/Bugs">bug interface</a>. The faster bugs are found or suggestions made, the quicker we can implement
them.
<li> Get an account on bio.perl.org by emailing <a href="mailto:dag@sonsorol.org">dag@sonsorol.org</a>. Learn how to use the cvs repository to work on the website, module documentation, scripts or code.
</ul>

<p>
There are lots of things to do in bioinformatics, and re-coding some
arcane format parsing or data structure layout should not be one of the
main things we do. Ask yourself what you spend most of your time doing...
<p>
Bioperl is all about being able to do interesting things and sharing the
ability to get through the tedium of bioinformatics.
