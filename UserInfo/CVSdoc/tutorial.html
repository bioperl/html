<TITLE> A CVS Tutorial for NuTeV </TITLE>
   <H1> A CVS Tutorial for NuTeV </H1>

	This is a step-by-step set of instructions on how to use CVS, 
written for the users on experiment E815.  The first list explains how
to get the source code for a product and use it for your own
applications. <P> 

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="T1"> Getting a new Product </A></H2>

	The basics of getting a new product is fairly easy.  Most (but 
not neccessarily all) products are designed with a Makefile so that you 
can create a default executable and start running immediately.  

<PRE>
<B>1. (Optional)</B> &gt; mkdir <VAR>productdir</VAR>

<B>2. (Optional)</B> &gt; cd <VAR>productdir</VAR>

<B>3.           </B> &gt; cvs checkout <VAR>productname</VAR>

<B>4.           </B> &gt; cd <VAR>productname</VAR>

<B>5.           </B> &gt; make
</PRE>

	You should always check the README document, if there is one, or 
consult other sources.  See the list of <A HREF="../cvs_software.html">
Software Available in CVS</A> for product names and links to WWW 
documentation.  <P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>1-2 (Optional): Creating a product directory.</STRONG>

<DD> CVS will make its own directory for the source code it takes
from the repository.  However, if you are going to be significantly 
customizing or adding to the code, it is helpful to have a personal 
area separate from the ``pure'' product code.  <P>

<DT><STRONG>3: Checking out the product.</STRONG>

<DD> This creates a new subdirectory of the current directory, with a 
directory name the same as the name of the product.  

<DT><STRONG>4-5: Making the executable.</STRONG>
<DD> Several products have a default Makefile which lets you create an 
     executable quickly.  You should check for the specifics, however.  
</DL>

	For more details on this, see the section on 
<A HREF="commands.html#checkout">cvs checkout</A> in the full
documentation. <P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="T2"> Updating Your Version </A></H2>

	In order to get all the updates which have been made to the
product, simply go into the <VAR>productname</VAR> directory and say: 

<PRE>
<B>1.      </B> &gt; cvs update -d 
</PRE>

	CVS will automatically <STRONG>merge</STRONG> the changes made 
to the repository and the changes which you have made.  It will keep what 
changes you have made, and overlay the changes which have been made to the 
repository. This is indicated by the output which the <SAMP>cvs update</SAMP> 
command produces, which looks something like:  <P>

<PRE>
U afile.F
M changedfile.F
U driver.F
A newfile.F
? userfile.f
</PRE>

	The single-letter code on the left indicates what has happened 
to that file.  The <STRONG>only</STRONG> code which you have to worry 
about would be a `<SAMP>C</SAMP>' - which would indicate that your 
changes and the repository changes <EM>conflict</EM>.  This means that 
you have to go into that file, and edit it to be the version which you 
want. Within the file, you will find something like: <P>

<PRE>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
   avar = value1
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
   avar = value2
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
</PRE>

	The first code is the repository change, the second is the change 
which you made.  You have to delete the version you don't want, and 
remove all the <SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>'s and <SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>'s. <P>

	The other codes mean the following: <P>

<UL>
<LI> <SAMP>U</SAMP> : 
	the file was <EM>updated</EM> to match the repository
<LI> <SAMP>M</SAMP> : 
	your changes were <EM>merged</EM> with changes in the repository
<LI> <SAMP>A</SAMP> : 
	the file was recently <EM>added</EM> to the repository
<LI> <SAMP>?</SAMP> : 
	the file was unrecognized and ignored - it is not in the repository
</UL>

	For more details on this, see the section on 
<A HREF="commands.html#add">cvs add</A> in the full documentation. <P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="T3"> Committing Changes to the Central Repository </A></H2>

	The most important thing to remember in committing is to be 
careful.  Test the code <EM>exactly</EM> as it will appear in the 
repository (i.e. no user-only routines or changes).  You should inform 
whoever is in charge of that code what you are going to do.  Assuming 
he or she approves, then the steps are as follows: <P>

<DL>
<DT> <SAMP> &gt; setenv EDITOR <VAR>yourfavorite</VAR> </SAMP>
<DD> This line should probably be added to your <CODE>.login</CODE> file. 

<DT><B>(Optional)</B> <SAMP> &gt; cvs add <VAR>newfilename</VAR> </SAMP>
<DD> If you are adding a new file or directory to the repository, you must 
specify it in advance of committing.  Otherwise CVS will just ignore it.  

<DT> <SAMP> &gt; cvs commit <VAR>filename</VAR> </SAMP>
<DD> This commits the changes you have made to file <VAR>filename</VAR> to 
the central repository.  If you leave <VAR>filename</VAR> blank, it will 
commit <EM>all</EM> the changes you have made to the code. <P>

	Upon the <SAMP>commit</SAMP> command, CVS will demand from you a 
comment for the record on the changes which you have done (using the 
editor defined in the first step).  For most significant changes, you 
should also send a note to the NuTeV Bank System. <P>
</DL>

<A HREF="commands.html#commit">cvs commit</A> in the full documentation. <P>
