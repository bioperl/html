<TITLE> All environment variables that affects CVS </TITLE>
   <H1> All environment variables that affects CVS </H1>

	This is a complete list of all environment variables that
affect CVS. <P> 

<DL>
<DT> $CVSREAD
<DD> If this is set, <code>checkout</code> and <code>update</code> will
  try hard to make the files in your working directory read-only.
  When this is not set, the default behavior is to permit modification
  of your working files. 

<DT> $CVSROOT
<DD> Should contain the full pathname to the root of the CVS source
  repository (where the RCS history files are kept).  This information
  must be available to CVS for most commands to execute; if
  <code>$CVSROOT</code> is not set, or if you wish to override it for
  one invocation, you can supply it on the command line: <samp>cvs -d
  cvsroot cvs_command...</samp> You may not need to set
  <code>$CVSROOT</code> if your CVS binary has the right path compiled
  in. <P>

	If your site has several repositories, you must be careful to
  set <code>$CVSROOT</code> to the appropriate one when you use CVS,
  even if you just run <samp>cvs update</samp> inside an already
  checked-out module.  Future releases of CVS will probably store
  information about which repository the module came from inside the 
  <code>CVS</code> directory, but version 1.3 relies totally on 
  <code>$CVSROOT</code>. <P>

<DT> $EDITOR
<DD> Specifies the program to use for recording log messages during
  commit.  If not set, the default is <samp>/usr/ucb/vi</samp>.

<DT> $PATH
<DD> If <code>$RCSBIN</code> is not set, and no path is compiled
  into CVS, it will use <code>$PATH</code> to try to find all
  programs it uses.

<DT> $RCSBIN
<DD> Specifies the full pathname of the location of RCS programs,
  such as co(1) and ci(1).  If not set, a compiled-in value is used,
  or your <code>$PATH</code> is searched. 
</DL>

CVS is a front-end to RCS.  The following environment
variables affects RCS: <P>

<DL>
<DT> $LOGNAME
<DT>x $USER
<DD> If set, they affect who RCS thinks you are.  If you have trouble
  checking in files it might be because your login name differs from
  the setting of e.g. <code>$LOGNAME</code>.

<DT> $RCSINIT
<DD> Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A
  backslash escapes spaces within an option. The <code>$RCSINIT</code>
  options are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.

<DT> $TMPDIR
<DT>x $TMP
<DT>x $TEMP
<DD> Name of the temporary directory.  The environment variables are
  inspected in the order they appear above and the first value found
  is taken; if none of them are set, a host-dependent default is used,
  typically <code>/tmp</code>.
