   <H1> Reference manual for the Administrative files </H1>

	Inside the repository, in the directory
<code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT</code>, there are a number of supportive files
for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited fashion without any of them,
but if they are set up properly they can help make life easier. <P>

	The most important of these files is the <code>modules</code> 
file, that defines the modules inside the repository. <P>

<UL>
* modules::                     Defining modules
* commit files::                The commit support files
* commitinfo::                  Pre-commit checking
* editinfo::                    Specifying how log messages are created
* loginfo::                     Where should log messages be sent?
* rcsinfo::                     Templates for the log messages
* cvsignore::                   Ignoring files via cvsignore
* history file::                History information
* Setting up::                  Setting up the repository
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="D1"> The modules file </A></H2>

	The <code>modules</code> file records your definitions of
names for collections of source code.  CVS will use
these definitions if you create a file with the right
format in <code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules,v</code>.  The
mkmodules(1) command should be run whenever the modules
file changes, so that the appropriate files can be
generated (depending on how you have configured CVS
operation). <P>

To allow convenient editing of the <code>modules</code> file
itself, the file should include an entry like the
following (where <var>localbin</var> represents the
directory where your site installs programs like
mkmodules(1)): <P>

<PRE>
modules    -i /<var>localbin</var>/mkmodules CVSROOT modules
</PRE>

This defines the name <samp>modules</samp> as the module name
for the file itself, so that you can use

<PRE>
$ cvs checkout modules
</PRE>

to get a copy of the file that you can edit.  You should define
similar module entries for the other configuration
files described in this appendix, except
<code>history</code>). <P>

	The <code>modules</code> file may contain blank lines and
comments (lines beginning with <samp>#</samp>) as well as
module definitions.  Long lines can be continued on the
next line by specifying a backslash (<samp>\</samp>) as the
last character on the line. <P>

	A module definition is a single line of the
<code>modules</code> file, in either of two formats.  In both
cases, <var>mname</var> represents the symbolic module name,
and the remainder of the line is its definition. <P>

<DL>
<DT> <var>mname</var> -a <var>aliases</var>...
<DD> This represents the simplest way of defining a module
  <var>mname</var>.  The <samp>-a</samp> flags the definition as a
  simple alias: CVS will treat any use of <var>mname</var> (as a
  command argument) as if the list of names <var>aliases</var> had
  been specified instead. <var>aliases</var> may contain either other
  module names or paths.  When you use paths in aliases,
  <code>checkout</code> creates all intermediate directories in the
  working directory, just as if the path had been specified 
  explicitly in the CVS arguments.

<DT> <var>mname</var> [ options ] <var>dir</var> 
     [<var>files</var>... ] [ &<var>module</var>... ] 
<DD> In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
  <samp><var>mname</var> <var>dir</var></samp>.  This defines all the
  files in directory <var>dir</var> as module mname. <var>dir</var> is
  a relative path (from <code>$CVSROOT</code>) to a directory of
  source in the source repository.  In this case, on checkout, a
  single directory called <var>mname</var> is created as a working
  directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
  even if <var>dir</var> was a path involving several directory
  levels.  <P>

	By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after
  <var>dir</var>, you can select particular files from directory
  <var>dir</var>.  The sample definition for <samp>modules</samp> is
  an example of a module defined with a single file from a particular
  directory.  Here is another example:

<PRE>
m4test  unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4
</PRE>

  With this definition, executing <samp>cvs checkout m4test</samp>
  will create a single working directory <code>m4test</code>
  containing the two files listed, which both come from a common
  directory several levels deep in the CVS source repository. <P>

	A module definition can refer to other modules by including
  <samp>&amp<var>module</var></samp> in its definition.
  <code>checkout</code> creates a subdirectory for each such module,
  in your working directory. (Note: ``in your working directory'' is
  wrong. What is right?) 

  <DL>
  <DT> -d <var>name</var>
  <DD> Name the working directory something other than the module
	name. 

  <DT> -i <var>prog</var>
  <DD> Specify a program <var>prog</var> to run whenever files in a
	module are committed.  <var>prog</var> runs with a single 
	argument, the full pathname of the affected directory in a
	source repository.  The <code>commitinfo</code>, 
	<code>loginfo</code>, and <code>editinfo</code> files provide 
	other ways to call a program on commit.

  <DT> -o <var>prog</var>
  <DD> Specify a program <var>prog</var> to run whenever files in a
	module are checked out.  <var>prog</var> runs with a single
	argument, the module name.

  <DT> -s <var>status</var>
  <DD> Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is
	printed with <samp>cvs checkout -s</samp> the modules are
	sorted according to primarily module status, and
	secondarily according to the module name.  This option
	has no other meaning.  You can use this option for
	several things besides status: for instance, list the
	person that is responsible for this module.

  <DT> -t <var>prog</var>
  <DD> Specify a program <var>prog</var> to run whenever files in a
	module are tagged with <code>rtag</code>.  <var>prog</var> runs
	with two arguments: the module name and the symbolic
	tag specified to <code>rtag</code>.  There is no way to
	specify a program to run when <code>tag</code> is executed.

  <DT> -u <var>prog</var>
  <DD> Specify a program <var>prog</var> to run whenever <samp>cvs
	update</samp> is executed from the top-level directory of the
	checked-out module.  <var>prog</var> runs with a single
	argument, the full path to the source repository for
	this module.
  </DL>
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="D2"> The commit support files </A></H2>

	The <samp>-i</samp> flag in the <code>modules</code> file can
be used to run a certain program whenever files are committed
(@pxref{modules}).  The files described in this section provides
other, more flexible, ways to run programs whenever something is
committed.  <P>

	There are three kind of programs that can be run on
commit.  They are specified in files in the repository,
as described below.  The following table summarizes the
file names and the purpose of the corresponding
programs. <P>

<DL>
<DT> commitinfo
<DD> The program is responsible for checking that the commit is
allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status the commit will be
aborted. 

<DT> editinfo
<DD> The specified program is used to edit the log message, and
possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is most
useful in combination with the <code>rcsinfo</code> file, which can 
hold a log message template (@pxref{rcsinfo}).

<DT> loginfo
<DD> The specified program is called when the commit is complete.  It
receives the log message and some additional information and can store
the log message in a file, or mail it to appropriate persons, or maybe 
post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your imagination is the limit!
</DL>


<H3> The common syntax </H3>

	The four files <code>commitinfo</code>, <code>loginfo</code>,
<code>rcsinfo</code> and <code>editinfo</code> all have a common
format.  The purpose of the files are described later on.  The common
syntax is described here. <P>

Each line contains the following:
<UL>
<LI> A regular expression
<LI> A whitespace separator---one or more spaces and/or tabs.
<LI> A file name or command-line template.
</UL>

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the
character <samp>#</samp> are treated as comments.  Long lines
unfortunately can <em>not</em> be broken in two parts in
any way. <P>

	Whenever one of the regular expression matches a directory
name in the repository, the rest of the line is used. <P>



<H2><A NAME="D3"> Commitinfo </A></H2>

	The <code>commitinfo</code> file defines programs to execute
whenever <samp>cvs commit</samp> is about to execute.  These programs
are used for pre-commit checking to verify that the modified, added
and removed files are really ready to be committed.  This could be
used, for instance, to verify that the changed files conform to 
your site's standards for coding practice. As mentioned earlier, each
line in the <code>commitinfo</code> file consists of a regular
expression and a command-line template.  The template can include a
program name and any number of arguments you wish to supply to it.
The full path to the current source repository is appended to the
template, followed by the file names of any files involved in the
commit (added, removed, and modified files). <P>

	All lines with a regular expression matching the
relative path to the module will be used.  If any of
the commands return a non-zero exit status the commit
will be aborted. <P>

	If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <samp>DEFAULT</samp>
line is used, if it is specified. <P>

	If the name <samp>ALL</samp> appears as a regular expression
it is always used in addition to any matching regular
expression or <samp>DEFAULT</samp>. <P>



<H2><A NAME="D4"> Editinfo </A></H2>

	If you want to make sure that all log messages look the
same way, you can use the <code>editinfo</code> file to
specify a program that is used to edit the log message.
This program could be a custom-made editor that always
enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a
simple shell script that calls an editor, and checks
that the entered message contains the required fields. <P>

	If no matching line is found in the <code>editinfo</code>
file, the editor specified in the environment variable
<code>$EDITOR</code> is used instead.  If that variable is not
set a precompiled default, normally <code>vi</code>, will be
used. <P>

	The <code>editinfo</code> file is often most useful together
with the <code>rcsinfo</code> file, which can be used to
specify a log message template. <P>

	Each line in the <code>editinfo</code> file consists of a
regular expression and a command-line template.  The template must 
include a program name, and can include any number of arguments.  The
full path to the current log message template file is appended to the
template. <P> 

	One thing that should be noted is that the ALL keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the last one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory. <P>

	If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status,
the commit is aborted. <P>



<H3> Editinfo example </H3>

	The following is a little silly example of a
<code>editinfo</code> file, together with the corresponding
<code>rcsinfo</code> file, the log message template and an editor
script.  We begin with the log message template. We want to always
record a bug-id number on the first line of the log message.  The rest
of log message is free text.  The following template is found in the
file <code>/usr/cvssupport/tc.template</code>. <P>

<PRE>
BugId:    
</PRE>

The script <code>/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit</code> is used to
edit the log message. <P>

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
#       bugid.edit filename
#
#  Call $EDITOR on FILENAME, and verify that the
#  resulting file contains a valid bugid on the first
#  line.
$EDITOR $1
until head -1|grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' &lt $1
do  echo -n  &quotNo BugId found.  Edit again? ([y]/n)&quot
    read ans
    case $@{ans@} in
        n*) exit 1;;
    esac
    $EDITOR $1
done
</PRE>

The <code>editinfo</code> file contains this line:

<PRE>
^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit
</PRE>

The <code>rcsinfo</code> file contains this line:

<PRE>
^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template
</PRE>


<H2><A NAME="D5"> Loginfo </A></H2>

The <code>loginfo</code> file is used to control where
<samp>cvs commit</samp> log information is sent.  The first
entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the <code>$CVSROOT</code>.  If a match is found, then
the remainder of the line is a filter program that
should expect log information on its standard input. <P>

The filter program may use one and only one % modifier
(a la printf).  If <samp>%s</samp> is specified in the filter
program, a brief title is included (enclosed in single
quotes) showing the modified file names. <P>

If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <samp>DEFAULT</samp>
line is used, if it is specified. <P>

If the name <samp>ALL</samp> appears as a regular expression
it is always used in addition to any matching regular expression or
<samp>DEFAULT</samp>. <P>

All matching regular expressions are used. <P>

@xref{commit files}, for a description of the syntax of
the <code>loginfo</code> file. <P>



<H3> Loginfo example </H3>

	The following <code>loginfo</code> file, together with the
tiny shell-script below, appends all log messages  to the file
<code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog</code>, and any commits to the
administrative files (inside the <code>CVSROOT</code> directory) are a
also logged in <code>/usr/adm/cvsroot-log</code> and mailed to
<samp>ceder</samp>. <P>

<PRE>
ALL             /usr/local/bin/cvs-log $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog
^CVSROOT        Mail -s %s ceder
^CVSROOT        /usr/local/bin/cvs-log /usr/adm/cvsroot-log
</PRE>

The shell-script <code>/usr/local/bin/cvs-log</code> looks
like this: <P>

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
(echo &quot-------------------------------------------------------------&quot;
 echo -n $USER&quot  &quot;
 date;
 echo;
 sed '1s+'$@{CVSROOT@}'++') >> $1
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="D6"> Rcsinfo </A></H2>

	The <code>rcsinfo</code> file can be used to specify a form to
edit when filling out the commit log.  The <code>rcsinfo</code> file
has a syntax similar to the <code>editinfo</code>,
<code>commitinfo</code> and <code>loginfo</code> files.
@xref{syntax}.  Unlike the other files the second part is <em>not</em>
a command-line template.  Instead, the part after the regular
expression should be a full pathname to a file containing the log
message template. <P>

	If the repository name does not match any of the
regular expressions in this file, the <samp>DEFAULT</samp>
line is used, if it is specified. <P>

	If the name <samp>ALL</samp> appears as a regular expression
it is always used in addition to the first matching
regular expression or <samp>DEFAULT</samp>. <P>

	The log message template will be used as a default log
message.  If you specify a log message with <samp>cvs
commit -m <var>message</var></samp> or <samp>cvs commit -f
<var>file</var></samp> that log message will override the
template. <P>

@xref{editinfo example}, for an example <code>rcsinfo</code>
file. <P>



<H2><A NAME="D7"> Ignoring files via cvsignore </A></H2>

	There are certain file names that frequently occur inside your
working copy, but that you don't want to put under CVS control.
Examples are all the object files that you get while you compile your
sources. Normally, when you run <samp>cvs update</samp>, it prints a 
line for each file it encounters that it doesn't know about
(@pxref{update output}). <P>

	CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns) that it
should ignore while running <code>update</code>. This list is
constructed in the following way. <P>

<UL>
<LI> The list is initialized to the following file name patterns:

<PRE>
    RCSLOG  RCS     SCCS
    CVS*    cvslog.*
    tags    TAGS
    .make.state     .nse_depinfo
    *~      #*      .#*     ,*
    *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
    *.a     *.o     *.so    *.Z     *.elc   *.ln  
    core
</PRE>

<LI> The per-repository list in <code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore
</code> is appended to the list, if that file exists.

<LI> The per-user list in <code><samp>$HOME</samp>/.cvsignore</code>
is appended to the list, if it exists.

<LI> As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents of any
<code>.cvsignore</code> will be appended to the list. The patterns
found in <code>.cvsignore</code> are only valid for the directory that
contains them, not for any sub-directories.
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="D8"> The history file </A></H2>

	The file <code>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</code> is used to log
information for the <code>history</code> command (@pxref{history}).
This file must be created to turn on logging.  This is done
automatically if the <code>cvsinit</code> script is used to set up the
repository. <P>

	The file format of the <code>history</code> file is
unfortunately not yet documented anywhere, but it is
fairly easy to understand most of it. <P>



<H2><A NAME="D9"> Setting up the repository </A></H2>

	When you install CVS for the first time, you should follow the
instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file to set up the repository. <P>

	If you want to set up another repository, the easiest way to
get a reasonable set of working administrative files is to get the
source to CVS, and run the <code>cvsinit</code> shell script.  It will set
up an empty repository in the directory defined by the environment 
variable <code>$CVSROOT</code>.  (<code>cvsinit</code> is careful to never
overwrite any existing files in the repository, so no harm is done if
you run <code>cvsinit</code> on an already set-up repository.) <P>
