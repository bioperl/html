<p>
Our group owes its early organizational support to its association with the <a href="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/bcd/Transfer97/award.html">award-winning</a> VSNS-BCD <a href="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/bcd/welcome.html">BioComputing
Courses</a>; some students of the 1996 course (Chris Dagdigian, Richard Resnick, Lew Gramer, Alessandro Guffanti, and others) have contributed code and commentary. Georg Fuellen, the VSNS-BCD chief organizer was one of the driving forces behind bioperl. Steven Brenner, who was an early adopter of Perl for
bioinformatics provided some of the early work on bioperl. Lincoln Stein
has long provided guidance and code.
<p>
Bioperl was then taken up by people developing code at the large
genome centres. In particular at Stanford, Steve Chervitz at the
Genome Sequencing Centre (St Louis) Ian Korf and at the Sanger Centre
(Cambridge UK) Ewan Birney.  All of the C code XS extensions were
provided by Ewan Birney. Bioperl is used in anger at these sites,
indicating that is both useful and that it works.
<p>
Jason Staijch and Hilmar Lapp joined bioperl for the drive towards a
0.7 release over 2000 and the first part of 2001, which includes a
revised feature location model, richer feature objects (in particular
genes) and more and better tools. Peter Schatner and Lorenz Pollak
contributed serious chunks of code, being the AlignIO and bptutorial
scripts and the BPLite port to bioperl respectively. At this time
Bioperl was being used in absolute earnest by the Ensembl group which
shook out a number of problems in the code base. Additional
compatibility with the Sequence Workbench (bioperl-gui) (Mark
Wilkinson and David Block) and Biocorba (Jason Staijch, Brad Chapman
and Alan Robinson) and finally Game-XML (Brad Marshall) provided more
interoperability.
<p>
Jon Orwant at <a href="http://www.tpj.com">The Perl Journal</a> gave us permission to reprint
<a href="GetStarted/tpj_ls_bio.html">Lincoln Stein's article</a>. He also worked with the <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl Institute</a> (now the Perl Mongers) to arrange our perl.org DNS entry. 
<p>
Current server hardware for bioperl.org (and other open-bio.org hosted
projects) was provided by Compaq Computer Corporation.  The donation
was facilitated by both the Pharmaceutical Sales and High Performance
Technical Computing (HPTC) groups.
<p>
The bioperl servers reside in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA with
colocation facilities and internet bandwidth donated by Genetics
Institute. In particular Dr. Steven Howes, Kenny Grant &
Rich DiNunno have made significant efforts on our behalf.
