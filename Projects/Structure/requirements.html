<h2>
Preliminary requirements list for a Structure object
</h2>

<hr>

This is an initial listing. It is not necessarily complete. Also, not
all of the things listed here need to go into the Structure object
itself. Think of this is a rough set of use-cases for biomolecular
structure information, which should be considered when designing a
structure object.

<p>
<b>Send suggestions to <a href="mailto:sac@neomorphic.com">sac@neomorphic.com</a>

<p>
The requirements seem to fit into 6 main categories:
<ol type="I">
<li><a href="#atoms">Atomic coordinates</a>
<li><a href="#features">Structural features</a>
<li><a href="#anal">Analyzing structures</a>
<li><a href="#edit">Editing structures</a>
<li><a href="#seq">Sequence information</a>
<li><a href="#db">Database information</a>
</ol>

<!--     Atomic Coordinates Requirements     -->

<p>
<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="atoms">
<li>Atomic Coordinates
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Parse and output different structure file formats, at a
  minimum PDB but could include mmCIF, CML/XML, and other formats.
<li>Be able to obtain different representations the structural coordinates.
  For example, some applications require a hierarchical representation (complex, 
  molecule, residue, atom) while other require a non-hierarchically representation  
  (an array of atoms). Some applications may utilize minimal representations of the 
   structure, such as only backbone atoms (C-alpha or mainchain form
proteins; phosphodiester backbone for nucleic acids) or heavy-atom
only (no hydrogens, no waters).
<li>Convert between alternate representations of the structure. 
<li>Molecular coverage: at a minimum, support protein and nucleic acid xtallograpic and NMR
  structures and their heterogens. Multi-chain and multi-model (NMR) structures
 should also be supported.
<li>Theoretical structural models: Obtain quality factors and other
relevant modeling statistics. this will depend on the modeling
method. For a homology-based model, methods should be available to get
the structure and region of the structure the model is based on.

</ol>

<!--     Structural Feature Requirements     -->

<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="features">
<li>Structural Features
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>

<li>Provide methods for querying structure for statistics regarding
  atoms, hetatoms, connectivity, secondary structural elements,
  disulfide bonds, presence of alternate conformations, structure
  quality factors (resolution, R factor), crystal packing group,
  and other data obtainable directly from a PDB file.
<li> Obtain all atomic details for a given atom (xyz, atom serial
  number, atom name, chain name, residue name, residue number, occupancy, B-factor).
  For example, given an atom, determine what residue and what molecule
  (chain) it is in.
<li> Obtain information regarding what domains a given structure
  contains.

</ol>

<!--     Analyzing Structures -->

<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="anal">
<li>Analyzing Structures
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Display/select acidic, basic, polar and non-polar amino acids,
hydrogen  bonds
<li>Charge molecule and compute energy, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges.
<li>Compute the RMSD between to structures. Specify which regions of
each structure are to be superimposed.
<li>Compute a rotation/translation matrix for creating a minimum RMSD
alignment between structures or structural sub-regions.
</ol>


<!--     Editing Structures -->

<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="edit">
<li>Editing Structures
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add/remove/change residues, hydrogens, and water molecules.
<li>Energy minimize an altered structure.
</ol>


<!--     Sequence Information Requirements     -->

<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="seq">
<li>Sequence Information
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<li> Obtain a representation of the structure as sequence or
  a set of sequences (strings as well as specialized objects).
<li> Get sequence from the actual set of residues in the atomic
coordinate set.
<li> Map between residue numbers between the atomic coordinate set
and the numbers in the sequence string (say from a Fasta
representation). 
<li> Specify and generate subsections of the structure given a
  subsequence (range of integer positions as well as a sequence object).

</ol>



<!--     Database Information Requirements     -->

<ol type="I">
<h3>
<a name="db">
<li>Database Information
</a>
</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<li> Build a structure object given a valid structural database identifier.
<li> Obtain information about the structure given a valid structural
  database identifier. 
<li> Get URLs for web-based information about the structure.


</ol>
