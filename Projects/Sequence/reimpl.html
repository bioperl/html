<h2>Reimplementation</h2>

The top of this page is the final proposal by Ewan for the Seq.pm reimplementation. For
your reference, lower down the page there is some of the discussion which lead to this design.
<p>
The basic design pattern we are using here (along with the new parts of bioperl) is the "bridge",
which decouples the abstraction from the implementation of the object. Therefore two bioperl objects
are going to be written to deal with this: <b>Bio::SeqI</b> - abstract interface of Sequences + implementation
independent functions and <b>Bio::Seq</b> a pure perl implementation of the Bio::SeqI interface.
<hr>
<b>Bio::SeqI abstract definition</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>$obj->seq($start,$end) - returns the sequence of the object as a string. $start/$end are optional and
apply to absolute coordinates of the string 
<ul>
<p>
<font color=green>Unresolved questions</font>
<li>Do we specify the case of sequence characters? In which case, is it the same for the DNA and Protein types?
<li>Alphabets. How alphabet paranoid do we get?
</ul>
<li>$obj->id() - returns the id of the sequence. The id is its common name, ie swissprot-style id.
<li>$obj->accession() - returns the unique, stable, identifier of the sequence as a string. It can be undef, indicating that there is no unqiue identifier for this sequence (eg, because it was made on the fly). The accession field is
there to be used as a unique key for this sequence object in some manner. I suggest the following semantics
in the <a href="#accession">footnote</a> are used.
<li>$obj->desc() - a string of the description line. Can be undef. Although this field is here to cater
for people who use it, people are strongly encouraged <b>not to over use</b> this field for whatever additional
information they have. People should be pointed towards the AnnSeq object and inheritance off the Seq object
to get their information
<li>$obj->type() - a string of either 'dna','rna','amino', or 'unknown'. 
<li>$obj->can_call_new() - either 1 or a 0, meaning that other clients can call the new constructor on
this object to get a fresh object.
<li>$obj->new(%hash) - a constructor which takes a hashed parameter list, of the following meanings.
    <pre>
    -seq => $sequence_string
    -id  => $id
    -accession => $accession
    -type => <as in the type field>
    -desc => $description_string
    </pre>
</ul>
<i>Notes on this</i>. I have dropped the start/end/strand information. I am planning to make a "locatable
sequence object" as an inherited type of this, which will test out our ease of inheritance.
<p>
<b>Functions in Bio::SeqI which do not rely on implementation</b>
<ul>
<p><font color=green>Backward Compatibility functions. Will throw warnings</font>
<li>$obj->str() - returns a string of the sequence
<li>$obj->ary() - returns an array of the sequence
<li>$obj->getseq() - looks at wantarray, returns a string or an array
<p><font color=green>Other implementation-independant functions</font>
<li>$obj->length() - returns the length of the sequence.
<li>$obj->copy() - provides a copy of this sequence, using the underlying implementation if it is allowed to
<li>$obj->trunc($start,$end) - provides a truncation of the sequence, using the underlying implementation if it is allowed to
<li>$obj->revcom - provides a reverse complemented version of the sequence, using the underlying implementation if
it is allowed to
<p>
<li>$obj->translate - will throw a fatal error, explaining carefully how to write something which uses the
new translate functions in Bio::Tools::CodonTable->universal. 
</ul>
<i>Notes</i>. Translate is out but with a careful warning to get
people to migrate. This is a tough decision about whether to be correct
on the developers side or nice to our novice users.
<p>
The implementation-independant functions can be overriden by subclasses if they wish - it is
entirely up to the implementation if they want to provide these functions or not.
<hr>
<b>Bio::Seq</b>
<p>
Bio::Seq will be a straightforward perl implementation of the above abstract class, using
getset methods on seq, id, type and accession. Type will throw exceptions if you try to set
it to wrong types.

<hr>
<b>Accession number semantics</b>
<a name="accession"></a>
If accession matches ([\w\d]+)\.(\d+) it is a primary key to a database, (the database being undefinied by
the sequene object, but presumably however the user got the accession number would fill in this slot somehow).
The information before the . is the biologically stable version. The number after is the precise version. The
. and the number are optional
<p>
Whenever possible, things which make sequences should provide a
sensible primary key for this sequence, for example, the accession
number from the GenBank/EMBL database would be natural. However there
are cases when one can retrieve sequences with no idea of a
database. In this case the semantics below are defined.  
<p>
In cases where all we know about the sequence is how we loaded it in,
the accession is a valid URL indicating the file/server location with
the following additional qualifiers
<ul>
<li>If the url has a terminal --seq-format:(\w+) the word is assummed to be a placeholder for the format of the sequence
<li>If the url has a terminal --seq-format:(\w+):(\d+) the word is assummed to be a placeholder for the format and the
the number of the byte offset of the sequence in that stream.
</ul>




<hr>
<font color=red>Discussion before the above proposal</font>


This page is about the possible reimplementation of Seq.pm. I (Ewan) strongly feel
this should happen because:
<ul>
<li>There is too much code in Seq.pm, some useful, some not
<li>The design of the object is not that clean
<li>There is no clear interface definition for the object to allow
other implementations
<li>We need to seriously deprecate the IO handling of Seq.pm to using the SeqIO system.
</ul>

That said, I want to make it clear that we owe a great debt to the
designers and coders of Bio::Seq.pm, which has been the workhorse in
bringing bioperl together, the first object of bioperl and undoubtedly
the most used. This of course makes the challenge of reimplementation
that much harder, as this object is key for all of bioperl.

<p>
But like netscape with the switch to the NGL for Mozilla5 and other good projects, we need
to bite the bullet, and move on. I think a full scale reimplementation is needed, as the
code is semi-spagetti down there, documentation way out of whack (and in my opinion, far too long!),
and I think a certain design shift is needed.
<hr>
First off lets deal with some of the 'meta' issues involved with reimplementation and the
redesign
<ul>
<li>We need to discuss the design amongst the developers. As the core group will be
at heidelberg we can do most of it there, with a quick turn-around.
<li>We need to have a strong set of test cases built up to test the reimplementation.
<li>The current Seq.pm will not leave us, but move to OldSeq.pm so there is always
a migration path from the old to the new. An alternative is to make a NewSeq.pm and
use that, have a stable release with both current and NewSeq.pm and then map back. I do
not favour this.
<li>The Meta documentation from Seq.pm should be distributed elsewhere
</ul>
<hr>
The real redesign: 
<p>
<font color=red>Additions by other people are in red. Please post comments to the
guts list and I will integrate them on this page</font>

<p>
As a introduction to some of the bioperl concepts, Bioperl has started to make
"interface" files, which provide an abstract interface (like interfaces in Java)
about how particular objects should behave, regardless of their implementation.
This has proved very successful in the DB and SeqIO areas. Generally the interface
files are nearly always pure documentation: the methods just throw exceptions
indicating that the implementing object did not provide this method. An exception
to this are methods which rely *solely* on the interface, and effective operate
on top of the abstract interface. <font color=red>We are not sure what design pattern
this is, but it might be the bridge. Many thanks to Jeffrey Chang for pulling us up
on design points</font>
 For example, an interface could provide methods for
<pre>
     $obj->start()   # the start point
     $obj->length()  # the length of the object
</pre>
which some objects would implement as a lookup into a hash, and other objects as 
a lookup into a database. A decorating method would be
<pre>
     $obj->end()    # start+length, but no need to reimplement it
                    # achievable from just the start and length interface calls
</pre>
Decorating methods, although provided by the interface code can be overridden by
the implementation.
<p>
The proposal is to have the following two Perl Modules
<ul>
<li> Bio::SeqI - Sequence Interface and Decorating methods
<li> Bio::Seq  - a pure perl implementation of the Seq object
</ul>
<font color=red>Andrew Dalke spotted some typos/omissions that I have cleared up</font>
<p>
The Bio::SeqI interface would be something on these lines:
<ul>
<li>seq() - access to the sequence as a string
<li>id()  - access to the id (common name) of the sequence as a string
<li>accession() - access to the unique key for this sequence as determined by the
implementation. A suggestion is to use accession numbers
<li>start() - start point of the sequence, assummed to be meaningful somehow
<p>
<font color=red>Ian Korf is not keen on names/accessions or descriptions. Sequence should just be a
sequence</font>
<p>
<li>desc()  - a single string description with no other proscribed semantics
<li>length() - length of the sequence
<li>strand() - 1,-1 of the strandness 
<li>type() - returns a string of one of 'Dna', 'Rna', 'Amino' <font color=red>SteveB suggests
dna, rna, amino, although this might break some old scripts</font>
<li>can_call_new() - if returns 1, means can use the new constructor attached to the
sequence object for the copy and trunc functions
<li>new(hash) - returns a new object, which is intialised using the following hash values
       <ul>
         <li>-seq - a string of the sequence (must be provided)
         <li>-id  - a string of the name (must be provided)
         <li>-accession - a string of the accession (if not provided, assumme name)
         <li>-start - start position (if not provided, assumme 1)
         <li>-strand - strandness (if not provided, assumme 1)
	 <li>-desc   - description string (optional)
         <li>-type   - forces a particular type definition
       </ul>
<p>
The Bio::SeqI decorating methods would be
<p>
<li>str($start,$end) - access to the sequence currently employed by
Bio::Seq. The semantics of start/end wrt to start of the sequence has
to be defined.

<li>ary($start,$end) - access to the sequence data as currently employed by Bio::Seq
<li>getseq($start,$end) - access to the sequence data as currently employed by Bio::Seq
<li>copy() - provides a copy of the Seq object. If can_call_new returns 1, uses the
new constructor on this object. If not, uses a pure perl (Bio::Seq) implementation
<li>trunc($start,$end) - provides a truncation of the Seq object. If can_call_new returns
1, uses the new constructor on this object. If not uses a pure perl (Bio::Seq) implementation
The use of start/end should agree with the use in str.
<li>revcom() - provides a reversed and complemented copy. Standard constructor rules apply
as in copy and trunc. 
</ul>
The following methods I am not sure if they should be in or not
<ul>
<li>translate() - <font color=red>Ian Korf thinks this should be out. So do I...</font>
</ul>

<p>
The following methods should not be in the reimplementation:
<ul>
<li> names() - The accession has been promoted to a real field. All other stuff should 
go into the AnnSeq object 
<li> numbering() - deprecated
<li> origin - now a species object on AnnSeq
<li> ffmt - format issues done via SeqIO streams
<li> descffmt - format issues done via SeqIO streams
<li> all the out_* methods
</ul>

The following method will be in the actual Bio::Seq reimplementation
<ul>
<li>setseq() - sets the sequence
</ul>

<hr>
The Bio::Seq object. This object would be a pure perl implementation of the
first, interface definition above in Bio::SeqI. It would store fields as
a hash of values, with the hash names being bio_seq_<i>fieldname</i> to
allow inheritance and people who want to play with hashes the ability to.
The fields will be set-able via get/set pairs on the accessors
<ul>
<li>seq() - access and setting of sequences
<li>setseq() - sets the sequence
<li>id()  - access and setting of id
<li>accession() - access and setting of the accession
<li>start() - access and setting of the start point
<li>desc()  - access and setting of the description line
<li>length() - length on the sequence field
<li>strand() - access and setting of strandness
<li>type() - access and setting of type
</ul>

We need to
<ul>
<li>Discuss the reimplementation as a 'meta' issue
<li>Discuss the design
<li>Gather together retrograde tests and put together one
impressive test suite
<li>Do it!
</ul>
