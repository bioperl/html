<h2>Bioperl XML proposal</h2>

How should bioperl interact with XML? Here is my (Ewan's) view on this. It will
be good to get other people's views.
<p>
XML is a <b>data format</b> whereas bioperl is a set of <b>Perl Objects</b>. The
clearest way of thinking about this that XML is a natural <b>externalisation</b>
of bioperl objects.
<p>
Some bioperl objects already have good systems for externalising or internalising
themselves from datastreams, namely the Seq Object using the SeqIO system and the
AnnSeq object using the AnnSeqIO system. XML could be considered "just another format"
for these cases, and everthing would work ok. The problem about this is that
<ul>
  <li>Ideally XML should not just be another format, but a natural externalisation
of the bioperl objects
  <li>Treating it as "just another format" does not provide good, expected behaviour
for additional tags (the 'X' of XML) which would allow people to extend bioperl objects
in a data orientated manner. As there are alot of data orientated programmers out there
this would definitely be a good thing
<p>
<li>I'd like to say that I am <b>not</b> a data orientated programmer, and I think that
in many cases extending in data-orientated ways is a poor excuse for extending by object
based ways (eg, inheritance or composition/delegation). But... I know there are alot of
people who find data orientated programming natural and that we should support both styles
sensibly.
</ul>

As an additional problem, the externalisation has not to rely too much
on Perl implementations, as that would prevent people from providing
implementations based on other languages/programming methods (eg,
Python via a CORBA bridge or a DBI based wrapper over a RDB). This
means we have to be quite careful about what we assumme the objects
have and how we get data out of them

<hr>
Here is a proposal:
<p>
For externalisation
<ul>
<p>
<li>Each object which can be externalised has a method $obj->toXML(FILE) which dumps
the object as XML. The methods which the XML externalisation use should be defined as
an interface class and then for pure-perl implementations, provide a base class below
the root object that provides a pure perl implementation. The toXML method is a method 
defined in the interface class and calls the following methods.

<ul>
<li>$obj->base_XML. The internal state of the object is dumped as a specific XML type which is different
from object to object (as we can't know what data a particular object wants to save - 
some parts of the data can be dumped and some can't be)
<li>The objects contains a number of methods which represent data-orientated extensions
to this object, which I believe are something like:
    <ul>
     <li>$obj->has_extensions_XML. A method to say whether there is any extensions
     <li>$obj->keys_XML (returns an array of strings) A method for retrieving all the keys of the extensions 
     <li>$obj->data_XML($key) A method for each key which retrieves the data associated with this key (probably an array of values).
</ul>
<p>

<li>
The base class should contain ways of setting the following
attributes. We can provide a standard for doing this, probably
<ul>
<li>$obj->add_XML('key',$data)
</ul>
but implementations should not be forced to be carrying around general
arbitary hashes all the time, so an implementation must be able to say
'I don't do extensions'.

</ul>

These methods make this very similar to ACeDB and BoulderIO. I'll be talking to ACeDB and
BoulderIO gurus to see if this definition might also allow automatic ->toAce and ->toBoulder
methods. At the moment the above mechanism implies single tag extensions onto the object (no
deeper nestings), but the $obj->data_XML could return a hash if need be. Indeed we might be
able to use the actual BoulderIO classes as some sort of mix-in with the bioperl root object
stuff to do this - but don't hold your breath on that one.


</ul>
<hr>
For internalisation
<p>

There should be a SAX (event driven parser) system which is intialised
with Objects names that will be used when certain tags are hit. Then the
parser will load up a fromXML constructor specific for that family,
probably dragging in the actual class at run-time (like SeqIO does). It would be
up to the class to implement the precise fromXML function and for it to handle
tags that it was not interested in, placing them into the extension areas
sensibly

<hr>
Interaction between the internalisation and interface definitions.
<p>
We need to think about how internalisation works with interface defintions, and whether 
the base_XML definitions can or should happen in the interface definitions to the
bioperl classes. This would make the interface definitions in bioperl the key "object
modelling" definition area, which is quite an interesting idea.
