Bioinformatics interacts with databases considerably. Most of this interaction is
<b>read only</b>, that is people viewing or copying locally and then manipulating
data. There is a need for <b>read/write</b> but mainly in commerical ventures and
part of a larger system where bioperl will probably not be the central component.
It makes sense therefore to concentrate on read only aspects of it.
<p>
At the moment the main need is for access to sequence databases. The access should
have the following requirements:
<ul>
<li> It should provide sensible bioperl objects (eg Bio::Seq, or the AnnotatedSeq
suggested in the <a href="../SeqAnnot">SeqAnnot</a> pages),
<li> The implementation should be transparent to the client script/object, ie all
implementations work the same,
<li> It should be easy to add a new implementation (eg, for an in house RDB).
</ul>
Notice that following things are probably not needed:
<ul>
<li> A complex query ability. There is not enough schema agreement (let alone query
language) amongst sequence databases to let this happen,
<li> write ability.
</ul>

This suggests a pretty straight forward design of:
<ul>
<li>An abstract interface defining the methods that can be used,
<li>Implementations that inherit from that interface.
</ul>
This strategy is in place for the 0.05 release (due out in March 1999).
<hr>
Although the sequence database issue is relatively straightforward, a more complex
issue is how to deal with a meta database system of which the sequence database would be
one such type.
<p>
The meta db is to provide a way of specifying some biological information without
indicating a precise object or indeed the precise database to use (for example,
either EMBL or GenBank can provide DNA sequence from an accession number). 
In addition, it is probably limiting to restrict every type of biological information
to have one and one only object representation, but allow the precise object representation
to be determined by a client.
<p>
This meta database system <b>is not</b> something that we need in place now, but it is
important to think about it so that what we do does not clash with something in
the future.
<p>
The meta db system might have the following sort of design:
<ul>
<li>A Cross Reference object, which uniquely indicates some sort of biological data
without actually storing it, or knowing where it should found, or the object representation,
of it. It could be something as simiple as "Database = DNA, Primary_id = X46070".
<li>A Resolver object, which can take a Cross Reference object and return the biological
information indicated, potentially with a indication of the object type returned.
</ul>

For the moment, it is clear that the DB system developed for Sequence databases 
should not restrict the development of a meta database system
